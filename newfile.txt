SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to communicate with and manipulate databases. DBMS (Database Management System) is software that stores, manages, and provides access to databases, facilitating data organization, retrieval, and manipulation.

Normalization in DBMS

Normalization is a database design technique to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity by organizing tables and relationships.

1NF (First Normal Form):

Each table cell contains atomic (single) values.

Each record is unique with a primary key.

No repeating groups or arrays.

2NF (Second Normal Form):

Achieves 1NF.

All non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key (no partial dependency).

3NF (Third Normal Form):

Achieves 2NF.

No transitive dependency; non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.

SQL Queries

SQL queries are statements used to perform tasks such as retrieving data (SELECT), inserting data (INSERT), updating records (UPDATE), and deleting records (DELETE)
